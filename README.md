# End-to-End Secure Enterprise Network Simulation and Threat Mitigation System

This project demonstrates the configuration of a secure enterprise network environment using virtualized machines, network protocol optimizations, and advanced threat mitigation techniques. The system includes components such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs, SSL/TLS encryption, and mitigation of common network threats like DDoS and DNS spoofing.

## Project Overview

The project involves simulating an enterprise network with multiple virtual machines that replicate a real-world infrastructure, including web servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, VPNs, and secure protocols. The network is optimized for performance and security using modern techniques, with special attention to mitigating DDoS attacks, DNS spoofing, and ensuring secure communication via SSL/TLS.

### Key Features:
- Configured network protocols (TCP/UDP, DNS, SSL/TLS) for optimized and secure communication.
- Deployed 5+ firewalls to protect the network.
- Set up IDS/IPS (Snort) for intrusion detection and prevention.
- Configured VPN (OpenVPN) for secure remote access.
- SSL/TLS configuration for secure HTTPS communication on the web server.
- Mitigated DDoS and DNS spoofing attacks using best practices.
